# BANK-LOAN-PERFORMANCE-ANALYSIS
Interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing bank loan portfolio performance using KPIs, MTD &amp; MoM analysis, and risk segmentation (Good vs Bad Loans).

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a bank’s loan data to understand overall loan performance, repayment behavior, and borrower risk profile. 

I built this interactive Power BI dashboard to track key financial metrics and identify trends in loan applications, funding, and repayments.

- Monitor total loan applications and funded amounts  
- Track repayment performance  
- Identify good and bad loans  
- Analyze borrower financial indicators like interest rate and DTI  
- Study trends by state, loan purpose, and employment length
